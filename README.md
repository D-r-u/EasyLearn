## Technology Used
This project features the use of Natural Language Processing(NLP) for the implementation of
its functionality. Machine Learning (ML) is implemented using the Transformers model. Transformers are a groundbreaking architecture in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine translation. They employ a mechanism known as self-attention 
to process input data in parallel, allowing for more efficient learning and improved performance on sequential tasks.
